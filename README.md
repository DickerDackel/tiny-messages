# tiny-messages
A tiny message broker for my pygame projects

This started as a question on reddit, made me implement a prototype out of a
whim, and could now be used as a tool for my own game.

The package contains two different implementations of the same thing.  One
message broker that feeds messages into a callback, and one message relay that
forwards messages from one to n queues.
